# Bolts
Short talks and presentations with a focus on software.

## Introduction
A *bolt* is similar to a [lightning talk][wikipedia:lightning-talk].

> A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only a few minutes, given at a conference or similar forum.

It has a similar focus on being short, but this is not strictly enforced. We even expect the distribution of duration to have a [long tail][wikipedia:long-tail].

## Technology
A bolt can be made with any presentation technology, including not using any technology at all besides the art of story-telling.

In case you do want to present some slides, this repositories offers an opinionated template. It is a [remark.js][remark] based templated that produces a presentation that can be viewed with any web-browser. As such it is therefore also easy to host a bolt and share a link to it.

## Creating a bolt
The next steps can be followed to create a bolt.

1. Clone this [repository][github:self].
2. Copy the `template` directory to an apty-named subdirectory of `docs`.
3. Edit `presentation.md` to your hearts content.

There are various followup steps that one could do. Those include, but are not limited too:

* Style the bolt using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
* Present the bolt.
* Deploy the bolt.

See the template [`README`][self:template-readme] for more suggestions and information on how this can be achieved.
